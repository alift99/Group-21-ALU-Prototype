WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net buttoncond_gen_0[0].buttoncond/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin buttoncond_gen_0[0].buttoncond/io_led_reg[23]_i_2/O, cell buttoncond_gen_0[0].buttoncond/io_led_reg[23]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
